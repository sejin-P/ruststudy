# 궁금증

```rust
enum MyEnum {
None,
Some(u8),
}
```
여기서 niche optimization을 통해 None에 0을 배치하여 size가 u8을 안넘기도록 한다고 했는데, 만약 u8로 가능한 모든 값을 넣는다면?

When you use niche optimizations in Rust with the Option<u8> type, for example, it's critical to note that a u8 can only represent values from 0 to 255. If you try to assign a value outside of this range, you'll encounter a compile-time error.

In rust, I know that there is null pointer optimization. Rust guarantees that sizeof Option<T> equals to sizeof <T>, just for some types. How could it happen? There isn't any other spaces to assign null val.

Yes, you're right. This is a powerful optimization in Rust which applies to Option<T> when T is a non-nullable pointer type, such as &T, Box<T>, Rc<T>, etc. This also applies to fn, &mut T, NonNull<T>, and others.

Rust guarantees that a reference, like &T or &mut T, is never null. This allows Rust to use the null (or an otherwise invalid value) as a sentinel value to represent Option::None.

Here's an example:

rust
Copy code
let x: Option<&i32> = None;
In this case, Rust can represent x as a null pointer. When x is Some(&i32), Rust represents it as a normal non-null pointer.

This optimization doesn't apply to all types, only types that have a guaranteed invalid or unused value. For example, Option<bool> is larger than bool because there is no invalid bool value that could be used to represent None.

Note: In low-level terms, it's the bit-pattern 0x0 that is guaranteed to be never represented by a valid reference, which allows it to be used as None.

This kind of optimization is very valuable because it allows Option<T> to be used without any memory overhead in many cases, making Option<T> a zero-cost abstraction.

I couldn't understand it. There isn't any room for i32, because all of the numbers in i32 has each spaces.
ChatGPT
Yes, you're right. The Option<T> optimization is only applicable when T is a type for which some values are considered invalid and can be used to represent None. In the case of i32, there are no "invalid" or "unused" values - all possible 2^32 bit patterns correspond to a valid i32 value. Therefore, an Option<i32> must use some other mechanism to distinguish None from Some(x), and thus an Option<i32> is larger than an i32.

When we talk about the Option<T> optimization in Rust, we're usually talking about cases where T is a reference type (&T, Box<T>, etc.). In Rust, null references are not allowed, so a null reference can be used to represent None.

Here's an example:

rust
Copy code
let x: Option<&i32> = None;
In this case, Rust can represent x as a null pointer internally. If x were Some(&5), for example, then x would be a non-null pointer pointing to the memory location where 5 is stored.

So while it's true that there's no "room" for None in an i32, there is "room" for None in a reference type like &i32 because null references are not valid in Rust, and thus their bit pattern (usually all zeros) can be used to represent None.

This also applies to Box<T>, Rc<T>, and other pointer types, because they also cannot be null in Rust. However, this does not apply to types like i32 or bool, because all possible bit patterns for these types represent valid values.

Then I think other languages should do that optimization because size of pointer is same in same computer system.

In theory, any language could use null or other invalid values as a sentinel to optimize memory usage of optional types, as Rust does. However, there are some reasons why not all languages choose to do so:

Safety: In languages like C and C++, null pointers can lead to crashes if they're not handled properly. These languages allow null pointers, and they leave it up to the programmer to ensure they're never dereferenced. Rust, on the other hand, guarantees that references can never be null, which is why it can safely use null as a sentinel value.

Abstraction: In many high-level languages, pointers and memory management are abstracted away, and programmers don't typically need to think about them. In these languages, the benefits of memory optimization may not outweigh the complexity it introduces.

Backward compatibility: In some languages, changing the memory representation of optional types could break existing code. For example, in Java, null is a valid value for any reference type, and many programs rely on this behavior.

Rust is designed as a systems programming language, and one of its goals is to provide high-level abstractions without sacrificing control over low-level details. This is why it's able to provide powerful features like zero-cost abstractions and memory safety without a garbage collector.

This design philosophy is what allows Rust to use optimizations like the one we discussed, while also providing a safe and ergonomic programming model. As a result, programming in Rust can often involve a closer awareness of memory management and data representation than in many other high-level languages.
