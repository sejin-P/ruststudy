# String

## Conversation Between Chat GPT

As you said that String type is not reference, but adding '&*' to String value is possible even '*' is a dereference. How does it happen?

That's a great question! Rust indeed allows dereferencing (*) and re-referencing (&) a String. To understand this, we need to be clear about the nature of String in Rust.

In Rust, a String is a complex type that's implemented as a struct, it's not a primitive type. It is essentially a wrapper around a vector of bytes (Vec<u8>), and it represents a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string.

When you use the * operator on a String, it doesn't mean you're dereferencing a pointer or a reference as you would in languages like C or C++. Instead, it's calling a method named Deref::deref() which is part of the Deref trait that String implements.

In simple terms, you can consider the Deref trait as an overloading of the * operator. For a String, the deref() method returns a slice of its internal Vec<u8>. So, when you dereference a String using *, you're essentially converting the String into a str (string slice), which is a view into the original String.

Then, when you add & in front of * (&*), you're taking a reference to that str. This operation does not transfer ownership.

Here's an example:

rust
Copy code
let s = String::from("Hello, world!");
let ss: &str = &*s;
In this code, ss is a &str which references the same data as s but doesn't own it. This is similar to how you might use & to create a reference to an integer or another simple type, but in this case, you're creating a reference to a string slice.




What are the differences between String and str?

ChatGPT
String and str in Rust represent two ways of handling string data, with different characteristics. Here are some key differences:

Ownership and Mutability:

String is a growable, heap-allocated data structure that allows you to store an amount of text that is unknown to you at compile time. It owns its data, and can modify, extend or shrink the data it owns.
str (or string slice) is an immutable reference or view into a string data, which could either be a String or a string literal. It does not own its data, so it cannot be directly modified.
Storage Location:

String is always stored on the heap.
str could be anywhere (heap, stack, data segment, etc.), as it's just a view into some string data.
Size:

String has a dynamic size and can grow or shrink at runtime.
str has a fixed size that must be known at compile time (unless it's behind a pointer, like &str or Box<str>), because it represents an immutable view into an existing string.
Methods:

String has methods that allow modification (like push_str, push, remove, etc.), while str does not.
In general, you would use String when you need a mutable string that can change in size. You'd use str or &str when you only need to read from a string and won't need to change it. Here's an example:

rust
Copy code
let mut s = String::from("Hello");  // A String. It can be mutated.
s.push_str(", world!");             // Push a literal onto the String.

let r = &s[..];                     // A str. It cannot be mutated.
println!("{}", r);
In this example, s is a String, which can be modified. r is a &str, which cannot be modified and is just a view into s.
